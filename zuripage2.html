        <p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
        <div>
            <div>
                <p>Would I have to pay to enroll for the training?</p>
                <p>
                No, the program is completely free thanks to Ingressive For Good</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>What are the things I would need to participate?</p>
                <p>
                You'll need a laptop, internet connection and the willingness to learn through collaboration and mentorship.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>What happens if i join and I'm not active?</p>
                <p>
                Participants who join the program and stop engaging will be given the chance to catch up. You'll also be assigned a
                'study-mate' and mentor to help you. However, there is the possibility of not being promoted to the next stage if you
                remain inactive for too long</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Can I switch from the part-time track to full-time and vice versa?</p>
                <p>
                Unfortunately, no, you cannot switch from part-time to full-time and vice-versa</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Will I get paid?</p>
                <p>
                We reward some participants who complete tasks early, however, this is not a weekly reward. All the work that will be
                done during the program are hypothetical.</p>
